Upgrade from 0.7.0 to 0.8.x
===========================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.8, which is scheduled
to be released concurrently with SecureDrop 0.8.0 on June 26, 2018. Follow the
graphical prompts on your workstations to perform this upgrade.

For the *Journalist Workstations* and the *Admin Workstation*, the graphical
SecureDrop updater will also prompt you to update the SecureDrop code on your
workstations. This does *not* update the Tails operating system. The graphical
updater was introduced in SecureDrop 0.7.0. It looks like this:

.. |SecureDrop updater| image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

Click "Update Now" to perform the update on each workstation where this prompt
appears.

Removal of Two-Factor Authentication for Keyboard Login
-------------------------------------------------------

SecureDrop 0.8.0 removes the requirement for two-factor authentication when
logging into your server using an attached physical keyboard. This feature
provided no real security benefit, as it could easily be bypassed using single
user mode.

To ensure that you can login as the admin user using a physical keyboard, you may
wish to use this opportunity to cycle the admin user password on your SecureDrop
servers.

To do so, log into each SecureDrop server via SSH using your *Admin Workstation*.
Become the root user by typing ``sudo su``, then change the password for the
admin user by typing ``passwd <username>``, e.g., if your admin user account was
called ``alice``, you would type ``passwd alice``.

Enter a secure password and store it in the KeePassX password manager on your
*Admin Workstation*.

Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------

SecureDrop 0.8.0 ships with an update of the Linux kernel running on your
*Application* and *Monitor Servers*, from version 4.4.115 to version 4.4.135.
If you have not previously changed your default kernel, your server will
boot into the new kernel automatically on its next reboot.

We have tested this kernel extensively against :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`
and other common configurations. Compared with the previous kernel, it ships with
additional hardware support. If you are experiencing an outage after the update,
it may be due to differences between the two kernel versions relevant to your
specific configuration.

Please consult our :doc:`kernel troubleshooting guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`
for instructions on how to compare the differences between kernel versions and
how to roll back to an earlier version if necessary.

.. important::

  It is of critical importance for the security and stability of your instance
  that you :ref:`report kernel compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  to us as soon as you become aware of them.

Enabling the New Kernel After a Downgrade
-----------------------------------------

If you have previously downgraded your kernel to the 3.14.x series due to
compatibility issues with the kernel that shipped with SecureDrop 0.7.0
(version 4.4.115), we urge you to test the new kernel (version 4.4.135). The new
kernel ships with expanded hardware support and is intended to address the
hardware compatibility issues that we are aware of.

You can test the new kernel without downtime by following
:ref:`our instructions for testing and enabling a new kernel after a downgrade
<Test and Enable an Updated Kernel>`. Please note that this is *only* necessary
if you have manually downgraded the kernel; otherwise, the new kernel will be
enabled automatically.

If the new kernel does not address compatibility issues on your hardware, please
let us know as soon as you can by following :ref:`our instructions for reporting
compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`. We intend to remove support
for kernel series 3.14.x in a future release, once all major compatibility
issues we are aware of have been resolved.
