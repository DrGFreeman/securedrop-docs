Upgrade from 0.9.1 to 0.10.0
============================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.10, which was released
concurrently with SecureDrop 0.10.0 on October 23, 2018. Follow the Tails
graphical prompts on your workstations to perform this upgrade.

For the *Journalist Workstation* and *Admin Workstation*, the graphical
SecureDrop updater will also prompt you to update the SecureDrop code
on your workstation. The updater was introduced in SecureDrop 0.7.0. It
looks like this:

.. image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

If you don't see a graphical updater, you may be running an older
version of the SecureDrop code on your workstation (earlier than
0.7.0). If that is the case, refer to :ref:`this guide <update_workstation_code_from_070>`
to get onto the latest workstation code.

.. important:: 
        If you haven't already updated your workstations when SecureDrop
        0.9.1 was released, you'll need to update your workstations
        manually. Due to a bug in the graphical SecureDrop updater that was
        fixed in SecureDrop 0.9.1 (released on September 6, 2018),
        attempting an update of your SecureDrop workstation code on your
        *Journalist* or *Admin Workstations* using the graphical updater
        may fail with an error message: "WARNING: Signature verification failed."

        Should you encounter this message, follow the instructions in the
        :doc:`Upgrade from 0.8.0 to 0.9.1<0.8.0_to_0.9.1>` guide.


Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------

If you have previously downgraded your kernel, as part of the the upgrade
process to SecureDrop 0.10.0, the default Linux kernel will change to the
latest released kernel (version 4.4.144). 

We have tested this kernel extensively against :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`
and other common configurations. Please consult our :doc:`kernel troubleshooting guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`
for instructions on how to compare the differences between kernel versions and
how to roll back to an earlier version if necessary.
 
.. important::

  The 3.14.x series kernel will be removed with release 0.11.0 (scheduled
  for December 11). Please :ref:`report kernel compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  immediately to avoid extended downtime.
