Upgrade from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
===========================

SecureDrop 1.1.0 is the first release to ship with support for using Tails 4
(scheduled to be released on October 22, 2019) on your *Admin Workstation*, your
*Journalist Workstation*, and your *Secure Viewing Station*.

Because the Tails 3 series will stop receiving security updates with the release
of Tails 4, it is important that you update your workstations to Tails 4 soon
after its release on October 22, 2019.

Update the SecureDrop code on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations* first,
then upgrade all workstations (including the *Secure Viewing Station*) to Tails
4 by following the procedure described in this document.

Updating workstations to SecureDrop 1.1.0
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.1.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the automated update fails, you can perform a manual update by running the
following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.1.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.1.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.1.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. include:: ../upgrade_to_tails_4.rst
